# ArduinoNetwork
In this project, an Arduino board is utilized to read temperature and humidity data using a DHT11 sensor. The acquired sensor readings are then displayed on a webpage through an Ethernet interface.
The Arduino code provided enables the board to collect precise temperature and humidity values from the environment using the DHT11 sensor. The data is subsequently transmitted to a webpage via an Ethernet connection.

The main file, "main.ino," serves as the central component of the project, containing the Arduino code responsible for reading the sensor values and establishing seamless communication with the Ethernet interface.
